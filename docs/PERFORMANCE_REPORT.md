## Index Usage Analysis

### Indexes Created
1.  Text index: `{ name: "text", cuisine: "text", description: "text" }`
2.  City index: `{ "location.city": 1 }`
3.  Cuisine index: `{ cuisine: 1 }`
4.  Rating index: `{ rating: -1 }`
5.  Price range index: `{ priceRange: 1 }`
6.  Geospatial index: `{ "location.coordinates": "2dsphere" }`

### Index Utilization
- Text searches: Using text index 
- Cuisine filters: Using cuisine index 
- Rating sorts: Using rating index 
- Geospatial queries: Using 2dsphere index

## Conclusion

Query response times are well within acceptable ranges, and the implemented caching system provides significant performance improvements for repeated queries.

The application is production-ready for small to medium-scale deployments. For larger scale operations, the recommendations section should be implemented.
